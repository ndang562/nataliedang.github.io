## Learning
Looking back on this semester, it struck me how much I learned from 314-Software Engineering  came in handy and enhanced the experience of this class.  Early on, my team faced the challenge of deciding which tools and frameworks to use for our project. After realizing that we needed to use react as it would be easier, we decided to go with react. This decision proved to be rewarding. The project came with challenges and questions, but being able to overcome them has taught us the importance of teamwork and the ability to be open minded. Everyone was able to bring what they were strong in, and it was motivating to see how our ideas evolved into user friendly  applications.

## My expreince
I was able to create the audit page, write mathematical equations,and design the calculator. With these tasks it made me think outside of the box. When I had to do the audit page because it had to be user-friendly and complete, with the equations and calculator running smoothly and efficiently. Creating the mathematical equations and calculator was another challenge. The thing that made it difficult for me was coming up with equstions that would match up with the files that were given. As any mitakes could jeopardize the overall system's reliability. Each stage of the process used my problem-solving skills, but I was ready for that task that was given. This experience improved my technical skills,but it also increased my appreciation for the team work and creativity that define software engineering.
