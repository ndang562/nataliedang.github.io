During my high school years, I developed a captivating game that challenged users to navigate through a virtual environment by employing their jumping skills while avoiding various obstacles. This involved crafting an engaging digital experience where players had to skillfully maneuver their avatars to evade oncoming objects.The interactive nature of the game not only showcased my technical skills in game development but also aimed to captivate community within the high school setting.


Joining SCI-Mi has been a transformative experience for me as a computer science researcher. In my role, I collaborate with a dynamic team dedicated to advancing research in the fields of artificial intelligence (AI) and cybersecurity. Working alongside experts in these domains has provided me with invaluable opportunities to expand my knowledge and skills. The collaborative environment at SCI-Mi has not only fostered a sense of camaraderie but has also encouraged innovation and exploration. This exposure has been instrumental in my professional growth, allowing me to stay at the forefront of cutting-edge developments in AI and cybersecurity. The supportive and intellectually stimulating atmosphere has not only enhanced my understanding of these fields but has also allowed me to contribute meaningfully to groundbreaking research initiatives. Overall, being a part of SCI-Mi has not only shaped my trajectory as a computer science researcher but has also equipped me with the tools and insights necessary to excel in the ever-evolving landscape of AI and cybersecurity research.
